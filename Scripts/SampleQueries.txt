WIP:  detect duplicates.  A query I don't want to lose:
With HHS_Duplicates(SocSecNo, BirthDate, PartialLastName)
AS
(
	Select
		SocSecNo, BirthDate, SUBSTRING(LastName, 1,5)--, ResAddrCleansedZipCode
	From
		HHS_Staging.JFS.CRISE
	Where
		IsValid = 1 AND
		IsCleansed = 1

	INTERSECT
	Select
		SocSecNo, BirthDate, SUBSTRING(LastName, 1,5)--, ResAddrCleansedZipCode
	From
		HHS_Staging.DCFS.Persons
	Where
		isvalid = 1 and
		iscleansed = 1
)
Select
	*
From
	JFS.CRISE j
	JOIN
	HHS_Duplicates d
	ON
		j.SocSecNo = d.SocSecNo AND
		j.BirthDate = d.BirthDate


Select * from jfs.CRISE where SocSecNo = '287223478' ; Select * from DCFS.Persons Where SocSecNo = '287223478'

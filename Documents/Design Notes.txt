In case you're tempted to reorg Extract-CRM to separate data streams based on the number of service
(N1Service, N2Service, etc.) -- DON'T.

Each service is different when it comes to determining confidentiality.  For instance,
o JFS CRISE uses caseload structure (and so will need to join with DB02 CommonInfo)
o CFS SACWIS -- not sure what it uses but so far just age.

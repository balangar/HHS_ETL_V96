18 Oct 2018		In existing "outbound" and "archive" CRM-Extract.csv, there are some records with
					""HOMELESS""
					""C
				in address fields.  
				(Maybe need to use a different text delimiter ... or keep this stuff out of the output)

19 Apr 2018		Don't have Sacwis Case Id (Case Number?)
					For the time being, will just assign "Unavailable"

				Sacwis Staging data -- multiple records for the same person (<SocSecNo, Name, BirthDate>) with (possibly) distinct addresses
					** No one lives at multiple addresses at the same time **
					For now, I force unique record by picking just one.

23 Feb 2018		Need better SacwisID.  Right now, just making it up.
				Need better (and traceable) HHSID.  Right now, just making it up.
				Need better Address Cleansing. Right now, just Cuy county ... and not very good at that.

				*** Need structure for MDM.  Right now, extracting from HHS_Staging ***	
					Resolved 20 Apr 2018.  [geg]

07 Feb 2018		Just running HHS_Staging (JFS-Benefits and DCFS.Persons) into DIPT.  Longer term, need ... a different database, more of a data warehouse/star schema 

07 Feb 2018		Multiple records in HHS_Staging.DCFS.Persons with same SocSecNo and BirthDate.  
Supporting material: Select SocSecNo, Count(SocSecNo) From HHS_Staging.DCFS.Persons group by SocSecNo, IsValid, IsCleansed, isduplicate having count(SocSecNo) > 1 And IsValid = 1 and IsCleansed = 1 and isduplicate = 1 Order by count(SocSecNo) desc

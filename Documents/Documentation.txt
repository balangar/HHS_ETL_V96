Field validation
o The following fields are required to be present and syntactically valid (used during duplicate detection; ZipCode also used for address cleansing.:
	-- ZipCode
	-- SocSecNo
	-- BirthDate
	-- Last Name


Validate US zip codes. Matches all zip codes of exactly 5 digits except 00000. Optionally, matches zip5+zip4 where zip5 is exactly 5 digits, zip4 is exactly 4 digits, and zip5 and zip4 are, optionally, separated by a single space or hyphen. Captures zip5 and zip4 to named groups to facilitate program manipulation.
^(?!00000)(?<zip>(?<zip5>\d{5})(?:[ -](?=\d))?(?<zip4>\d{4})?)$

Validate Name
^[a-zA-Z]+(([',. -][a-zA-Z ])?[a-zA-Z]*)*$

Validate SocSecNo. Reference:  http://regexlib.com/Search.aspx?k=Social+Security+Number&c=-1&m=-1&ps=50

Also, doing sanity check on BirthDate:
	Invalid if Age >= 100; Invalid if Birthdate >= Today


o Address cleansing
	-- All non-Ohio addresses with syntactically valid ZipCodes are considered OK.
	-- All non-Cuyahoga Ohio addresses with syntactically valid ZipCodes are considered OK.
	-- Only Cuyahoga addresses (as determined by ZipCode) are cleansed
		-- Only attempting to reconcile (cleanse) city and Zip code.
		-- Cleansing on a "best effort" basis.
		-- Where I can't determine which city of a multi-city ZipCode is intended, I use "Cleveland"
		-- In general, I leave ResAddr* alone; Modifications, if any, to staged data are made only to ResAddrCleansedCity, ResAddrCleansedZipCode, ResAddrLine2 or ResAddrLine3.

o Some cleansed addresses are already available for JFS-Benefits.  See [MS-CUYIC-DB02].CommonTables.dbo.FOD_CrisERecipients_VW
o The staging table HHS_Staging.JFS.CRISE has columns for "ResAddrCleansedCity" and "ResAddrCleansedZipCode"
	-- The cleansing process populates these columns and modifieds ResAddrLine2 or ResAddrline3 as required.
o Address cleansing proceeds as follows (NB: I'm using tables [MS-CUYIC-DB02].CommonInfo.dbo.Cuyahoga_Municipalities_VW and Cuyahoga_MunicipalityZips_VW for Cuyahoga Zip Code and City info):
	-- Trival Case(s)
		o All syntactically valid non-Ohio addresses.
		o All syntactically valid non-Cuyahoga addresses.
		o For JFS-Benefits: If ResAddrCity = ResAddrCleansedCity  and ResAddrZipCode = ResAddrZipCode Then mark record as "cleansed"
	-- Where ResAddrCleansedZipcode doesn't exist and ResAddrZipCode is one of the "single city" zip Codes:
		o Replace ResAddrCleansedCity, ResAddrCleansedZipCode  and either ResAddrLine2 or ResAddrLine3 using info from CommonInfo lookup table.
	-- Where ResAddrCleansedZipCode doesn't exist and ResAddrZipCode is one of the "multi city zip codes":
		o If there's a sufficiently good match between ResAddrCity and City in CommonInfo lookup table (basically a match in the first 4 or 5 characters)
			-- Replace ResAddrCleansedZipCode, ResAddrCleansedCity and either ResAddrLine2 or ResAddrLine3 using info from CommonInfo lookup table.

Release 1.0 -- 04 May 2018
	This is the final 'Pilot' release ... or the first 'Production' release depending on your POV.

	Starting with this release:
		Each person will have a permanent synthetic id 
		SacwisID will be real 

	Going forward, only new or modified records will be extracted for loading into Infor CRM.
	
	Features
		Modifications made to both staging and "actual" tables to detet when a change occurs.

Release 0.1 -- dd mmm yyyy
	o First full data release for "Pilot".  Still a test release.
		Intent is for TAI to overwrite all previously supplied data
	o "PersonID" is synthetic but generating mechanism not yet fully defined
		So will likely change for final "Pilot" release
	o SACWIS ID  (Person ID) not available so using placeholder.

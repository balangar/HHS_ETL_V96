Directory _SCAS
	Extract from IMS database.
	Root matches directory name (in this case "SCAS")
	All others down one from the root.
	No need to process SBPT or SCOL files.
		These describe the running notes (aka "case notes") and, possibily, the financial files ("OFIN") which will be handled separately

The "Scrape\SBPT" directory contains ~227K files.
	o Files are basically CaseNotes or "Running Notes" for the OCSS Cases
	o A new note begins with the word "System"
	o Each record contains key info
	o May be more than one note on a given day
Marc says there's no need to parse these files.

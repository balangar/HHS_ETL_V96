Tue 2020-04-14	: Financial note layout (from Marc Alvarez.  See eMail this date, subject "RE: OCSS Archive ...  Financial records") (Best hint EVER!!!)


The fields are : 
	order number+|
	line number+|
	date+|
	type+|
	formatted data

The copy book for this record type has so many overlays that it's very difficult (at least for me) to make hide or hair of the formatted data.  So, I'm just going to use the bit of info that's invariant.
In particular, I intend to fetch info from only the first and the last line




Wed 2020-04-08	: Reactivation
	For Financial notes:
		embedded in the file name is the order number + a space + number of lines in the file (left pad, zero-filled 4 character string)
		a given file contains info one and only one order number

Directory _SCAS
	Extract from IMS database.
	Root matches directory name (in this case "SCAS")
	All others down one from the root.
	No need to process SBPT or SCOL files.
		These describe the running notes (aka "case notes") and, possibily, the financial files ("OFIN") which will be handled separately

The "Scrape\SBPT" directory contains ~227K files.
	o Files are basically CaseNotes or "Running Notes" for the OCSS Cases
	o A new note begins with the word "System"
	o Each record contains key info
	o May be more than one note on a given day
Marc says there's no need to parse these files.
